# Python - More Classes and Objects
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates More Classes and Objects
> specific to the Python programming language

## Description of what each file shows:
* 0-rectangle.py: An empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle

* 1-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `0-rectangle.py`)

* 2-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `1-rectangle.py`)

* 3-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `2-rectangle.py`)

* 4-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `3-rectangle.py`)

* 5-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `4-rectangle.py`)

* 6-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `5-rectangle.py`)

* 7-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `6-rectangle.py`)

* 8-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `7-rectangle.py`)

* 9-rectangle.py: A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `8-rectangle.py`)

* 101-nqueens.py: The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

	- Usage: `nqueens N`
		- [ ] If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print `Usage: nqueens N`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `1`
	- where N must be an integer greater or equal to `4`
		- [ ] If N is not an integer, print `N must be a number`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `1`
		- [ ] If N is smaller than 4, print `N must be at least 4`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `1`
	- The program should print every possible solution to the problem
		- [ ] One solution per line
		- [ ] Format: see example
		- [ ] You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
