 How to Use 1-my_list.py
========================

This library show usage of ``MyList``.

Lists
=====

``MyList`` inherits the object List.

::

    >>> MyList = __import__('1-my_list').MyList
    >>> new_list = MyList()
    >>> a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> b = 2
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]]

    >>> a = [[1, 2, 3]]
    >>> b = 2
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5]]

    >>> a = [[4], [5], [6]]
    >>> b = 4
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    [[1.0], [1.25], [1.5]]

    >>> a = [[4], [5], [6]]
    >>> b = float('inf')
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    [[0.0], [0.0], [0.0]]

Non-Lists
=========

``MyList`` is only designed to accept list
of lists, if one of the arguments is an integer, a
string, a list of any other data type or a tuple,
it should raise a TypeError

::

    >>> a = [1, (1, 2, 3)]
    >>> b = 3
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> a = [3, 4, 2]
    >>> b = 3
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> a = []
    >>> b = 3
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> a = [[]]
    >>> b = 3
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


``MyList`` is only designed to accept list
of lists with only integer values, if one of the
values is not an integer or float, it should raise a
TypeError

::

    >>> a = [[7, 'ag'], [9, 10]]
    >>> b = 2
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

``MyList`` is only designed to accept lists
and list of lists with equal rows, if one of the
row is a different length, it should raise a TypeError

::

    >>> a = [[7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]
    >>> b = 1
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

``MyList`` is only designed to divide with numbers
if the divsor is not an integer or a float, it should raise
a TypeError

::

    >>> a = [[7, 8, 9], [9, 10, 11]]
    >>> b = 'gg'
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: div must be a number

numbers can only be divided by nonzero

::

    >>> a = [[7, 8, 9], [9, 10, 11]]
    >>> b = 0
    >>> MyList(a, b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    >>> a = [[7, 8, 9], [9, 10, 11]]
    >>> MyList(a)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: MyList missing 1 required positional argument: 'div'

    >>> MyList
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: MyList missing 2 required positional arguments: 'matrix' and 'div'
